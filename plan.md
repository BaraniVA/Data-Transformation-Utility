- [x] Display uploaded files list showing names and row counts

---

## Phase 2: Column Mapping Workflow ✅
- [x] Extract and display all unique column names across uploaded files
- [x] Build UI for mapping old column names to new standardized names
- [x] Implement "Apply Mapping" functionality to rename columns using pandas
- [x] Show before/after column names comparison

---

## Phase 3: Filter & Cleanup Workflow ✅
- [x] Create filter rule builder with column selector dropdown
- [x] Add operation selector: equals, not equals, is empty, is not empty
- [x] Include value input field (conditional based on operation)
- [x] Support multiple filter rules with AND logic
- [x] Implement "Apply Filters" using pandas filtering operations
- [x] Display rows removed count after filtering

---

## Phase 4: Preview & Download System ✅
- [x] Build responsive data preview table with pagination (first 100 rows)
- [x] Display summary statistics: total rows, columns count
- [x] Implement individual file download as CSV
- [x] Create "Download All as ZIP" functionality
- [x] Add visual feedback for download actions

---

## Phase 5: Enhanced Filter Operations ✅
- [x] Add "contains" operation for substring matching in text columns
- [x] Add "not contains" operation for negative substring matching
- [x] Add "greater than" operation for numeric/date comparisons
- [x] Add "less than" operation for numeric/date comparisons
- [x] Add "greater than or equal" operation
- [x] Add "less than or equal" operation
- [x] Implement proper type detection for columns (numeric, text, date)
- [x] Show operation options based on column data type

---

## Phase 6: Data Validation Rules ✅
- [x] Create validation rules builder UI (separate section or tab)
- [x] Add validation types: required field, min/max length, numeric range, regex pattern
- [x] Implement validation execution using pandas validation logic
- [x] Display validation results: rows passing/failing, specific error messages
- [x] Add option to filter out invalid rows or flag them
- [x] Show validation report with details per rule

---

## Phase 7: Excel Export & Data Type Conversions ✅
- [x] Add Excel (.xlsx) export option alongside CSV
- [x] Create data type conversion UI for each column
- [x] Support conversions: text, integer, float, date, boolean
- [x] Implement pandas dtype conversion (astype, to_datetime, to_numeric)
- [x] Handle conversion errors gracefully with user feedback
- [x] Update download buttons to support both CSV and Excel formats
